This is a simple calculator that calculates what the maximum amount of equip load you need to have different weight loads

## How To Use It
In the first box, type how much weight you want to be able to carry.
Then, press the "Get Target Equip Weight" button. If it worked, you should see the "Target Equip Weight" change.
For example, "Target Equip Weight = 47.5".

In the second box, type your target percent.
There is a guide for percentages on the top of the website.
If it worked, you should see the "Target Percent" change.
For example, "Target Percent = 70"
# Do not type a percent symbol, only type the number.

Once you have done both of those, press the "Calculate Max Load" button.
If it worked, you should see the "Max Equip Load" change. For example, "Max Equip Load = 67.9"


I plan to add an automatic calculator that shows what endurance level you need to get your desired equip load.
